# Mini-Project-Portfolio-Assignment-2

**Read these instructions carefully to understand the requirements and functionalities for this project.**

We will be Creating a Single Page Portfolio using React for this Assignment. 

## What you will learn from this mini project ?

- props
- functional component
- how to create multiple component and use to build single application.
- Usage of Import, export and other es6 features.

## Functionalities

Below Functionalities should be implemented in your Project:

- Header section to navigate between `home`, `about` and `contact` pages (we can implement home page now and other pages can be built as extension of this project by youself).

- Home Page will have following sections:
  - Profile section that contain your image, name and bio.
  - Project section that contains list of projects along with urls.
  - Blog section, showing minimum of 4 blogs with name and url.
  - Footer section

## Task 1: Project Set Up

- Clone this repo by using [use template](https://github.com/frontbenchHQ/Mini-Project-Portfolio-Assignment-2/generate) option with name of repo as `Mini-Project-Portfolio-Assignment`.

- Clone your created repo and work on it to push your code.

- Use `githubbox.com` instead of `github.com` in your repository path, to create a synced codesandbox(always in sync with code in your repo). Read more [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing#import-from-github)

## Task 2: Project Requirements

- [ ] Create a Header Component. 
- [ ] Similarly, create component for Profile, project, blog and footer.
- [ ] Create a file `portfolioData.js` file.
- [ ] Put all your information such as  **profile information** (Name, image URL, bio description etc), **project data**  and other info  by making use of necessary data structure  such as array and object wherever needed.

**NOTE:** 
 - Use of **class component** is strictly `not allowed`.
 
 - There should not be any hard coded info in the project directly  so that in case if someone want to use same portfolio template/design  or you need to update any info , it can be just done by replacing/updating `portfolioData.js` file.

## Task 3

- [ ] Submit the code repo link.
